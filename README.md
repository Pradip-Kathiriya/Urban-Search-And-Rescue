# Urban-Search-And-Rescue
This project is inspired by the the challenge of autonomous robotics for Urban Search and Rescue (US&R). This is a simplified version of US&R where one robot(Explorer) moves
to 4 predefined location to detect the Barcode(AuRco Marker), detect and locate the marker and send the marker
location to another robot(Follower). Follower robot then visit each of these markers in order as per marker ID(Fiducial
ID). The program is written in C++ and simulation is done in Gazebo and RVIz.
